# Hover Sidebar

Open left and/or right sidebars on hover!

## Features

- _Won't_ collapse when **menus** or **modals** are on screen
- Can choose to be **floating** rather than shifting the layout upon expansion
- Can **pin** open (right click expand/collapse toggle)
- _Doesn't_ require the left ribbon to be visible
- **Customizable** trigger to open distance from left and/or right of screen

## Roadmap

- [ ] Don't collapse if mouse hovers back over an open sidebar (currently a bug actually)
- [ ] Right click sidebar to set pin/hoverable/floating
