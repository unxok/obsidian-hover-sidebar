# Hover Sidebar

Open left and/or right sidebars on hover!

## Features

- _Won't_ collapse/expand when **menus** or **modals** are on screen
- Can choose to be **floating** rather than shifting the layout upon expansion (not recommended for right sidebar)
- Can **pin** open or set to be **floating** by right clicking the expand/collapse toggle
- Can double click to **pin** open
- _Doesn't_ require the left ribbon to be visible
- **Customizable** trigger-to-open distance from left and/or right of screen
  - Can also turn on vertical lines in the settings to show where the trigger boundaries are
- **Customizable** time delay to keep sidebar open after mouse moves away (and keeps open if mouse comes back within that time frame)

## TO DO

- [ ] Add setting for open-delay to prevent accidental opening
